**A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.**

Handy is a cross-platform desktop application that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field. This happens on your own computer without sending any information to the cloud.

## Why Handy?

Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on [handy.computer](https://handy.computer):

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handy isn't trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it's trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handy processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you're using

The process is entirely local:

- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
- **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
- **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Architecture

Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
- `transcribe-cpp`: Local speech recognition with Whisper-family models (GGML/GGUF)
- `transcribe-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
- `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
- `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
- `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
- `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:

- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

### CLI Parameters

Handy supports command-line flags for controlling a running instance and customizing startup behavior. These work on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux).

**Remote control flags** (sent to an already-running instance via the single-instance plugin):

```bash
handy --toggle-transcription # Toggle recording on/off
handy --toggle-post-process # Toggle recording with post-processing on/off
handy --cancel # Cancel the current operation
```

**Startup flags:**

```bash
handy --start-hidden # Start without showing the main window
handy --no-tray # Start without the system tray icon
handy --debug # Enable debug mode with verbose logging
handy --help # Show all available flags
```

Flags can be combined for autostart scenarios:

```bash
handy --start-hidden --no-tray
```

> **macOS tip:** When Handy is installed as an app bundle, invoke the binary directly:
>
> ```bash
> /Applications/Handy.app/Contents/MacOS/Handy --toggle-transcription
> ```

## Known Issues & Current Limitations

This project is actively being developed and has some [known issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Bluetooth Headset Microphones (macOS)

Using a Bluetooth headset microphone on macOS may temporarily reduce playback quality or volume while recording because Bluetooth switches to bidirectional audio. Keep your headphones as the output device and select your Mac's built-in or an external microphone in Handy to avoid this.

### fn and Globe Key Shortcuts (macOS)

Shortcuts that include the `fn` (Globe) key **only work on Apple keyboards** — your Mac's built-in keyboard or an Apple external keyboard. They will never trigger on a third-party keyboard, even while it is connected to the same Mac.

This is a hardware limitation rather than a Handy bug. `fn` is not part of the standard USB HID keyboard specification: Apple reports it through a vendor-specific usage that macOS honors only from Apple devices, while third-party keyboards handle their `Fn` key entirely in firmware and send nothing to the computer. There is no event for Handy to listen for.

If you switch between a MacBook keyboard and an external one, pick a shortcut built from standard modifiers (`ctrl`, `option`, `shift`, `command`) or a regular key instead.

### Major Issues (Help Wanted)

**Whisper Model Crashes:**

- Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)
- Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
- If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!

**Wayland Support (Linux):**

- Limited support for Wayland display server
- Requires [`wtype`](https://github.com/atx/wtype) or [`dotool`](https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/) for text input to work correctly (see [Linux Notes](#linux-notes) below for installation)

### Linux Notes

**Text Input Tools:**

For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:

| Display Server | Recommended Tool | Install Command |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| X11 | `xdotool` | `sudo apt install xdotool` |
| Wayland | `wtype` | `sudo apt install wtype` |
| Both | `dotool` | `sudo apt install dotool` (requires `input` group) |

- **X11**: Install `xdotool` for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts
- **Ubuntu 26.04**: Has Wayland display server by default. `wtype` does not work, you need to install `ydotool` and configure systemd as described [here](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/557#issuecomment-3781249267).
- **Wayland**: Install `wtype` (preferred) or `dotool` for text input to work correctly
- **dotool setup**: Requires adding your user to the `input` group: `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` (then log out and back in)

Without these tools, Handy falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.

**Other Notes:**

- **Runtime library dependency (`libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`)**:
- Handy links `gtk-layer-shell` on Linux. If startup fails with `error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`, install the runtime package for your distro:

| Distro | Package to install | Example command |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Ubuntu/Debian | `libgtk-layer-shell0` | `sudo apt install libgtk-layer-shell0` |
| Fedora/RHEL | `gtk-layer-shell` | `sudo dnf install gtk-layer-shell` |
| Arch Linux | `gtk-layer-shell` | `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell` |

- For building from source on Ubuntu/Debian, you may also need `libgtk-layer-shell-dev`.

- The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (`Overlay Position: None`) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handy from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.
- If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` may help
- If Handy fails to start reliably on Linux, see [Troubleshooting → Linux Startup Crashes or Instability](#linux-startup-crashes-or-instability).
- **Global keyboard shortcuts (Wayland):** On Wayland, system-level shortcuts must be configured through your desktop environment or window manager. Use the [CLI flags](#cli-parameters) as the command for your custom shortcut.

**GNOME:**
1. Open **Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**
2. Click the **+** button to add a new shortcut
3. Set the **Name** to `Toggle Handy Transcription`
4. Set the **Command** to `handy --toggle-transcription`
5. Click **Set Shortcut** and press your desired key combination (e.g., `Super+O`)

**KDE Plasma:**
1. Open **System Settings > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**
2. Click **Edit > New > Global Shortcut > Command/URL**
3. Name it `Toggle Handy Transcription`
4. In the **Trigger** tab, set your desired key combination
5. In the **Action** tab, set the command to `handy --toggle-transcription`

**Sway / i3:**

Add to your config file (`~/.config/sway/config` or `~/.config/i3/config`):

```ini
bindsym $mod+o exec handy --toggle-transcription
```

**Hyprland:**

Add to your config file (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`):

```ini
bind = $mainMod, O, exec, handy --toggle-transcription
```

- You can also trigger Handy externally via Unix signals or the CLI flags, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings:

| Action | Trigger |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Toggle transcription | `pkill -USR2 -n handy` or `handy --toggle-transcription` |
| Toggle transcription with post-processing | `handy --toggle-post-process` |

Example Sway config:

```ini
bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy
bindsym $mod+p exec handy --toggle-post-process
```

`pkill` here simply delivers the signal—it does not terminate the process.

> **Behavior change:** older releases also accepted `SIGUSR1` for toggling transcription with post-processing. WebKitGTK — the webview engine embedded in Handy on Linux — uses SIGUSR1 internally to coordinate JavaScript garbage collection, so listening for it caused phantom recordings and interrupted dictations every few minutes ([#1660](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/1660)). Handy no longer listens for SIGUSR1 on Linux; the post-processing toggle is still available via `handy --toggle-post-process`. **Remove any `pkill -USR1` bindings**: the signal is now delivered straight to WebKit's internal handler and can crash the app.

**Overlay & Pasting Issues (Linux):**

- The recording overlay window can interfere with pasting transcribed text into target applications on Linux (X11)
- **Solution:** Open **Settings > Advanced** and set **"Overlay Position"** to **"None"** to disable the overlay
- Enable **"Audio Feedback"** (also in Advanced) if you still want audible confirmation of recording state
- Users who upgrade from older versions or import settings from other platforms may need to manually apply this change

### Platform Support

- **macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)**
- **x64 Windows**
- **x64 Linux**

### System Requirements/Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don't meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**

- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**

- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

## Roadmap & Active Development

We're actively working on several features and improvements. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

### In Progress

**Debug Logging:**

- Adding debug logging to a file to help diagnose issues

**macOS Keyboard Improvements:**

- Support for Globe key as transcription trigger
- A rewrite of global shortcut handling for MacOS, and potentially other OS's too.

**Opt-in Analytics:**

## Verify Release Signatures

Handy release artifacts are signed with Tauri's updater signature format. The public key is stored in [`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`](src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) under `plugins.updater.pubkey`.

To verify a release manually, set `ARTIFACT` to the filename you downloaded, save the `pubkey` value from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to `handy.pub.b
