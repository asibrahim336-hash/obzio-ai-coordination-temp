Graphiti is a framework for building and querying temporal context graphs for AI agents. Unlike static knowledge graphs,
Graphiti's context graphs track how facts change over time, maintain provenance to source data, and support both
prescribed and learned ontology — making them purpose-built for agents operating on evolving, real-world data.

Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, Graphiti continuously integrates user interactions,
structured and unstructured enterprise data, and external information into a coherent, queryable graph. The framework
supports incremental data updates, efficient retrieval, and precise historical queries without requiring complete graph
recomputation, making it suitable for developing interactive, context-aware AI applications.

Use Graphiti to:

- Build context graphs that evolve with every interaction — tracking what's true now and what was true before.
- Give agents rich, structured context instead of flat document chunks or raw chat history.
- Query across time, meaning, and relationships with hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword + graph traversal).

## What is a Context Graph?

A **context graph** is a temporal graph of entities, relationships, and facts — like *"Kendra loves Adidas shoes (as of
March 2026)."* Unlike traditional knowledge graphs, each fact in a context graph has a validity window: when it became
true, and when (if ever) it was superseded. Entities evolve over time with updated summaries. Everything traces back to
**episodes** — the raw data that produced it.

What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to autonomously build context graphs from unstructured and structured data,
handling changing relationships while preserving full temporal history.

A context graph contains:

| Component | What it stores |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Entities** (nodes) | People, products, policies, concepts — with summaries that evolve over time |
| **Facts / Relationships** (edges) | Triplets (Entity → Relationship → Entity) with temporal validity windows |
| **Episodes** (provenance) | Raw data as ingested — the ground truth stream. Every derived fact traces back here |
| **Custom Types** (ontology) | Developer-defined entity and edge types via Pydantic models |

## Graphiti and Zep

Graphiti is the open-source temporal context graph engine at the core of
[Zep's](https://www.getzep.com) context infrastructure for AI agents. Zep manages context graphs at scale, providing
governed, low-latency context retrieval and assembly for production agent deployments.

Under the hood, Zep is powered by a proprietary graph database — the
[Context Graph Engine](https://www.getzep.com/platform/context-graph-engine/) — built for millions of context graphs
with low-latency retrieval, so production deployments don't require a separate third-party graph database.

Using Graphiti, we've demonstrated Zep is
the [State of the Art in Agent Memory](https://blog.getzep.com/state-of-the-art-agent-memory/).

Read our paper: [Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture for Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956).

We're excited to open-source Graphiti, believing its potential as a context graph engine reaches far beyond memory
applications.

| Aspect | Zep | Graphiti |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **What they are** | Managed context graph infrastructure for AI agents | Open-source temporal context graph engine |
| **Context graphs** | Manages vast numbers of per-user/entity context graphs with governance | Build and query individual context graphs |
| **Graph database** | Proprietary [Context Graph Engine](https://www.getzep.com/platform/context-graph-engine/) — built for millions of context graphs with low-latency retrieval; no third-party graph database vendor required | Bring your own third-party graph database |
| **User & conversation management** | Built-in users, threads, and message storage | Build your own |
| **Retrieval & performance** | Pre-configured, production-ready retrieval with sub-200ms performance at scale | Custom implementation required; performance depends on your setup |
| **Developer tools** | Dashboard with graph visualization, debug logs, API logs; SDKs for Python, TypeScript, and Go | Build your own tools |
| **Enterprise features** | SLAs, support, security guarantees | Self-managed |
| **Deployment** | Fully managed or in your cloud | Self-hosted only |

### When to choose which

**Choose Zep** if you want a turnkey, enterprise-grade platform with security, performance, and support baked in.

**Choose Graphiti** if you want a flexible OSS core and you're comfortable building/operating the surrounding system.

## Why Graphiti?

Traditional RAG approaches often rely on batch processing and static data summarization, making them inefficient for
frequently changing data. Graphiti addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Temporal Fact Management:** Facts have validity windows. When information changes, old facts are
invalidated — not deleted. Query what's true now, or what was true at any point in time.
- **Episodes & Provenance:** Every entity and relationship traces back to the episodes (raw data) that produced it.
Full lineage from derived fact to source.
- **Prescribed & Learned Ontology:** Define entity and edge types upfront via Pydantic models (prescribed), or let
structure emerge from your data (learned). Start simple, evolve as patterns appear.
- **Incremental Graph Construction:** New data integrates immediately without batch recomputation. The graph evolves
in real-time as episodes are ingested.
- **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines semantic embeddings, keyword (BM25), and graph traversal for low-latency,
high-precision queries without reliance on LLM summarization.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently manages large datasets with parallel processing, pluggable graph backends, suitable
for enterprise workloads.

## Graphiti vs. GraphRAG

| Aspect | GraphRAG | Graphiti |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Primary Use** | Static document summarization | Dynamic, evolving context for agents |
| **Data Handling** | Batch-oriented processing | Continuous, incremental updates |
| **Knowledge Structure** | Entity clusters & community summaries | Temporal context graph — entities, facts with validity windows, episodes, communities |
| **Retrieval Method** | Sequential LLM summarization | Hybrid semantic, keyword, and graph-based search |
| **Adaptability** | Low | High |
| **Temporal Handling** | Basic timestamp tracking | Explicit bi-temporal tracking with automatic fact invalidation |
| **Contradiction Handling** | LLM-driven summarization judgments | Automatic fact invalidation with temporal history preserved |
| **Query Latency** | Seconds to tens of seconds | Typically sub-second latency |
| **Custom Entity Types** | No | Yes, customizable via Pydantic models |
| **Scalability** | Moderate | High, optimized for large datasets |

Graphiti is specifically designed to address the challenges of dynamic and frequently updated datasets, making it
particularly suitable for applications requiring real-time interaction and precise historical queries.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Neo4j 5.26 / FalkorDB 1.1.2 / Amazon Neptune Database Cluster or Neptune Analytics Graph + Amazon OpenSearch
Serverless collection (serves as the full text search backend) / Kuzu 0.11.2 (**deprecated**, see below)
- OpenAI API key (Graphiti defaults to OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Graphiti works best with LLM services that support Structured Output (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini).
> Using other services may result in incorrect output schemas and ingestion failures. This is particularly
> problematic when using smaller models.

Optional:

- Google Gemini, Anthropic, or Groq API key (for alternative LLM providers)

> [!TIP]
> The simplest way to install Neo4j is via [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/). It provides a user-friendly
> interface to manage Neo4j instances and databases.
> Alternatively, you can use FalkorDB on-premises via Docker and instantly start with the quickstart example:
> ```
> docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3000:3000 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:latest
> ```

```bash
pip install graphiti-core
```

or

```bash
uv add graphiti-core
```

### Installing with FalkorDB Support

If you plan to use FalkorDB as your graph database backend, install with the FalkorDB extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[falkordb]

# or embedded version (requires Python 3.12+)
pip install graphiti-core[falkordblite]
# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[falkordblite]
```

### Installing with Kuzu Support

> [!WARNING]
> **Kuzu is deprecated** and will be removed in a future release — the upstream Kuzu project is no longer
> maintained. New projects should use Neo4j or FalkorDB. The driver still ships for now but emits a
> `DeprecationWarning`.

If you plan to use Kuzu as your graph database backend, install with the Kuzu extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[kuzu]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[kuzu]
```

### Installing with Amazon Neptune Support

If you plan to use Amazon Neptune as your graph database backend, install with the Amazon Neptune extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[neptune]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[neptune]
```

### You can also install optional LLM providers as extras:

```bash
# Install with Anthropic support
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic]

# Install with Groq support
pip install graphiti-core[groq]

# Install with Google Gemini support
pip install graphiti-core[google-genai]

# Install with multiple providers
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic,groq,google-genai]

# Install with FalkorDB and LLM providers
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb,anthropic,google-genai]

# Install with Amazon Neptune
pip install graphiti-core[neptune]
```

## Default to Low Concurrency; LLM Provider 429 Rate Limit Errors

Graphiti's ingestion pipelines are designed for high concurrency. By default, concurrency is set low to avoid LLM
Provider 429 Rate Limit Errors. If you find Graphiti slow, please increase concurrency as described below.

Concurrency controlled by the `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` environment variable. By default, `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` is set to `10`
concurrent operations to help prevent `429` rate limit errors from your LLM provider. If you encounter such errors, try
lowering this value.

If your LLM provider allows higher throughput, you can increase `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` to boost episode ingestion
performance.

## Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Graphiti defaults to using OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding. Ensure that an `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your
> environment.
> Support for Anthropic, Gemini, and Groq is available, too. Other LLM providers — both hosted OpenAI-compatible APIs
> (DeepSeek, Together, OpenRouter, …) and local servers (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, LM Studio) — may be used via their
> OpenAI-compatible endpoints; see
> [Using Graphiti with OpenAI-compatible providers and local LLMs](#using-graphiti-with-openai-compatible-providers-and-local-llms).

For a complete working example, see the [Quickstart Example](examples/quickstart/README.md) in the examples directory.
The quickstart demonstrates:

1. Connecting to a Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, FalkorDB, or Kuzu database
2. Initializing Graphiti indices and constraints
3. Adding episodes to the graph (both text and structured JSON)
4. Searching for relationships (edges) using hybrid search
5. Reranking search results using graph distance
6. Searching for nodes using predefined search recipes

The example is fully documented with clear explanations of each functionality and includes a comprehensive README with
setup instructions and next steps.

### Running with Docker Compose

You can use Docker Compose to quickly start the required services:

- **Neo4j Docker:**

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start the Neo4j Docker service and related components.

- **FalkorDB Docker:**

```bash
docker compose --profile falkordb up
```

This will start the FalkorDB Docker service and related components.
